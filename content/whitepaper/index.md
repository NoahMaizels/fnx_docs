# Background & Philosophy:

## 02

In the past year, the crypto markets have declined, driven widely by the fall in price of
Bitcoin. With the fiat prices of BTC, ETH, and other major cryptocurrencies falling by
80% or more, the decline has been dramatic. However, this decline does not mean that
crypto is dead. In fact, even traditional markets such as Wall Street go through similar
cycles of (if not quite so dramatic) rise and decline. From the ashes of each recession,
new businesses emerge, and the economy continues to grow and develop. Every
downturn ends in a rebirth, and these periods afford opportunities to those willing to
take them.

In the world of blockchain, it is no different. While fintech innovation often stirs up
controversy (the newly announced Facebook Libra being the most notable recent
example), it continues to play an important role in our lives. We expect its impact will
only grow larger with time. Declining markets are an opportunity for blockchain
advocates to better reflect on and deal with the pain points and defects that have been
holding back adoption. It is the time to begin exploring new paths. We believe that there
are three key pain points which have been holding back adoption of blockchain
decentralized finance, or DeFi, and we propose FinNexusas the solution.


# Background & Philosophy:

## Diversity

## Fundamental Value

As Nobel laureate James Tobin once said when asked to summarize his approach to risk,
the best advice for any person is “don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” This idea was
mirrored by the emphasis Harry Markowitz placed on the importance of diversity in his
work on risk and portfolio theory which underlie modern portfolio management strategies
today. While there has been an explosion of crypto tokens over the last several years, the
vast majority of them share similar profiles: high volatility, high return potential, high risk,
and a high BTC price correlation. Market participants, for their part, have differing
appetites for risk at different times. At present, the lack of product variety suitable for
differing risk profiles is keeping many participants out of the market who might otherwise
be happy to participate. Especially with the recent bear market, many existing participants
saw only one option, to leave, which further exacerbated the market’s decline.

If innovation, belief, and risk are the seeds of business, value is the crop which grows
from these seeds. Traditional industries directly produce value, the Internet enhances
value by increasing the efficiency of connection, and modern finance amplifies value
through the flow of capital. Value is the root and the foundation stone for all business.

The same is true in the short history of the crypto economy. Bitcoin, for example, serves
as both a store of value and a value exchange mechanism. Exchanges and OTC dealers
provide value by providing liquidity, and mining pools provide the basic security and
operational infrastructure for the entire blockchain network. These entities not only create
or magnify value within the crypto economy, but also become the biggest beneficiaries.
Whether the tokens generated from the business model come with business value is the
one of the key factors in deciding the success of a project in the crypto economy.


# Background & Philosophy:

Though decentralized blockchain technology has set down roots in many fields, the
marriage with traditional finance and blockchain based asset diversification is still in the
early stages. To what extent should crypto assets be included in one’s portfolio and how
should we combine traditional financial instruments and methodologies with the
blockchain technology are questions that lie at the core of the FinNexusvalue
proposition.

The blockchain applications of today share the same problems of email and other
applications from the early Internet era. At the time, many users were turned off by
email’s then unfamiliar and complex usage, and many simply didn’t understand its
usefulness. Blockchain based applications today face similar challenges. Interfaces are
cumbersome and difficult to navigate, requiring an investment of time and mental effort
on the part of the user before they are accessible. Something as seemingly simple as
using cash to purchase cryptocurrency, and then using that cryptocurrency to purchase
another digital asset can be overwhelmingly complex for users. This is especially the
case when assets are spread across many different exchanges and sale portals. Before
they can reach any real level of adoption, DeFiapplications must become as user
friendly as their traditional counterparts.

Most would much rather buy a house than build their own. While there exist the intrepid
few who are willing and able to put in the time and effort needed to build their own
house, the vast majority of us would much rather just buy. Currently, investing in crypto
is much more like building your own house than it is like buying a pre-made one. Users
need to manage multiple exchanges, ICO mechanisms, private keys, hardware and
software wallets, and more if they wish to access a diverse range of crypto assets. While
there are many innovative and useful crypto projects out there such as MakerDAO, dydx,
and more, users must mix and match and deal with many different systems and
interfaces to meet their unique needs. This fragmentation has kept away many users
who are otherwise interested in crypto but lack the time or ability or even just the
patience to navigate this complex ecosystem.

## Convenience


# Background & Philosophy:

```
(Stable Triangle)
```
## The DeFi trilemma

We believe that diversity, value, and convenience are the three major pain points for
crypto investors. By addressing the three issues stated above, investing in the crypto
economy can become more like buying a house than building your own. Value is the
foundation, while diversity and convenience are the scaffolding that allow user
requirements to be met. With those issues addressed, the crypto economy will be
healthier, and adoption will increase. Similar to the scalability trilemma of
decentralization, scalability, and security introduced by VitalikButerin, the DeFitrilemma
of diversity, fundamental value, and convenience represent the major challenges which
must be overcome for the industry to move forward. Addressing the DeFitrilemma will
form the foundation for future business and technological revolution. Our perspective is
that any successful DeFiproject must adequately resolve this trilemma. The design and
operation of the FinNexusproject will focus on these three aspects. We believe that
these simple but universal requirements are the foundation for promoting business
progress and technological revolution in the decentralized finance industry.


# FinNexusObjectives And Definition

## 06

In the crypto economy, there exist a number of different connectivity needs. The need for
connectivity between assets and blockchains, between users and blockchains, and
between different service providers and their users. Currently these connections are ad
hoc, unsystematic, and highly inconvenient. Instead, the connections should be unified,
user-friendly, and generalizable. FinNexusis a general protocol aiming at providing those
connections.

Here ‘connection’ refers not only to technological connections, but also business
connections. Therefore, FinNexusis not just a technological protocol, but also a business
protocol. Moreover, FinNexusis not just one protocol, but in fact a collection of multiple
protocols which together compose the FinNexusecosystem.

```
（FinNexusInfrastructure ）
```

# FinNexusObjectives And Definition

1. It will be easier for participants to look for, manage and acquire blockchain-
based assets.
**(Connection between users and blockchains)**
2. It will be easier for asset owners to conveniently offer on-chain assets.
**(Connection between assets and blockchains)**
3. It will be easier for OTC platforms, brokers and exchanges to find users and
provide them services.
**(Connection among service providers and their users)**
4. All the participants above can use FinNexusin an open, transparent and equal
way, so as to fulfill the requirements of diversity, convenience and value.


# Detailed Description of FinNexus

## 08

**Connection between users and blockchains:** FinNexusis an application layer
protocol. Blockchains are low-level systems, which, like databases, would not generally
involve direct interaction with users. Instead, users employ tools such as wallets or
browsers to interact with the blockchain. Most of these cases are currently limited to very
basic interactions. For complex scenarios, interactions are not intuitive and user friendly.

FinNexusis an application layer protocol for decentralized financial services which allows
users (developers, service providers, and project participants) to easily interact with the
blockchain. FinNexusis focused on interactions related to financial services. The
application layer protocol connects users at one end and connects various public chains
and second layer networks on the other end. The FinNexusprotocol removes much of the
friction commonly encountered when using blockchain based protocols by unifying and
standardizing many different services under the parent FinNexusprotocol.


# Detailed Description of FinNexus

## 09

```
Connection between assets and blockchains:
```
**FinNexusis an asset channel for the blockchain world.** Assets need to flow between
the traditional economy and the crypto economy, between different entities in the crypto
economy, and between different chains. These types of flows are impeded not only by
technological barriers but also by commercial and legal barriers. FinNexusaims therefore to
provide not only technological connections, but also legal and business connections. By
setting up these connections at business, legal, and technological levels, FinNexusaims to
establish asset channels which allow for the frictionless flow of assets.

By building these qualified asset channels, FinNexusaims to satisfy the demand for asset
diversity by enabling the flow of a wide variety of assets including both native crypto assets,
traditional assets, and hybrid traditional/crypto assets. This will give users around the world
access to a wide range of products with diverse risk profiles.

In addition to reducing friction and providing a more convenient experience, these channels
will also greatly increase asset liquidity. Liquidity will attract more users to participate in the
crypto economy and lead to a virtuous cycle where the addition of more users improves the
experience for everyone.


```
Connection among different service providers:
```
**FinNexusconnects service providers with their users and also allows for
collaboration between service providers.** The development of the crypto industry will
inevitably expand into more and more subdivisions. The trend of multiple service providers
being involved in an asset’s lifecycle is becoming more and more obvious, leading to an
increase in situations requiring collaboration between several or many different service
providers. However, collaboration currently still relies entirely on traditional trust-based
systems since trustless blockchain-based infrastructure is still not mature enough for many
real-world use cases. FinNexusaims to provide a transparent, standardized, and trustless
means of collaboration between different service providers in order to allow providers to
work together in a secure and efficient way. FinNexuswill connect settlement services,
trading platforms, brokerage, and a wide range of other service providers.

## 10

# Detailed Description of FinNexus


# Structure of FinNexus

## 11

The first part is a technological connection layer, which will serve as the hub for
information transmission. This layer allows for information to flow in and out of FinNexus
through different hubs.

The second part is the rule layer for the formal definition of DeFiuse case logics, which
allows for standardized collaboration among different participants in the ecosystem. This
layer will initially have a core set of rules available for use and will be open to the public
for extension.

The third part is the external system layer, which refers to all the external systems related
to the DeFiecosystem. Rather than building DeFiapplications and systems ourselves
from scratch, FinNexusintends to connect various DeFirelated applications and systems
together to form a rich DeFiecosystem.

### FinNexuscan be divided into three parts.


**Gateway** ：
The FinNexusgateway is used for information exchange and interaction between the
FinNexussystem and external distributed infrastructures such as public blockchains and
layer two networks. FinNexuswill gradually integrate SDKs of different public distributed
ledgers and layer two networks, and abstract the common functions of these SDKs, such
as account generation, putting assets on chain, transactions, contract triggering, and
other common operations. Since each chain has different commands to manipulate those
interactions, FinNexusGateway will standardize those interactions to allow for easy
integration and interaction between chains and services.

**API** ：
FinNexushas two sets of APIs. One set are the standard APIs for external applications.
The standard APIs will be encapsulated in FinNexusand can be called by other
components and interact with external applications which include but are not limited to
exchanges, lending platforms, OTC platforms, etc. The other set are the APIs provided by
FinNexusitself. Those APIs are used for ecosystem partners to access FinNexus.

**SDK** ：
FinNexuswill provide a standard SDK for developers to build FinNexusbased dApps.

**Protocol** ：
The connection layer will implement a communication protocol for standardized
information sharing within FinNexusand with external systems.

**Account System:**
There aretwotypes ofaccount systemsinFinNexus: 1 ) thetraditionalaccountsystem
and 2 ) the blockchain account system. These two systems separately meet the
requirementsofusersandapplicationscenarios.ThetraditionalaccountsystemhasKYC

**Demand Matching System Services:**

secondary markets, and other non-continuous bidding markets. In cases where
continuous bidding is required, FinNexus will connect with external trading platforms
throughitsconnectionlayerinordertoprovidesuchdemandmatchingfunctions.

**Fund Settlement System:**
FinNexus will adopt a variety of different mechanisms for settlement. In some cases,

otherscenariosthatcannotbeimplementedthroughsmartcontracts,FinNexuswillclear
andsettlefundsusingFinNexus’sstandardizedprotocols.ForfiatsettlementFinNexuswill
cooperatewithinstitutionswithlegallicensesintheirrespectiveregions.

**Reward Distribution System:**
Within its collaborative financial services ecosystem, FinNexuswill often require the
function of rewards distribution in exchange for contributions or work performed.
FinNexuswill develop a standardized rewards distribution model which allows for unique
rewards distribution schemes to be defined according to the requirements of different
scenarios. Participants can determine their own reward distribution schemes, and
FinNexuswill then automatically calculate and distribute rewards through the system.

## 13

The blockchain account system will also be integrated with hardware solutions for a
more secure and flexible account management approach.

# Structure of FinNexus


**Distributed Infrastructure:**
As a decentralized financial platform, the most important external systems for FinNexusto
connect with are various public chains and layer two networks including cross-chain
protocols, the Lightning Network, Plasma, and others. FinNexusaims to be applicable in a
wide range of different application scenarios and to emphasize user experience in its
implementation. FinNexuswill make the blockchain user experience more accessible and
friendly to the ordinary user by acting as a unified hub for various distributed ledger
networks.

**dApps(Decentralized applications):**
FinNexuswill connect various dApps, including decentralized exchanges, decentralized
stable coins, decentralized OTC platforms, decentralized lending platforms, oracles, and
many more.

**Centralized apps:**
While the essence of FinNexusis distributed ledger technology, centralized applications
will undoubtedly also play an important role in the DeFiecosystem. This means it is
essential for FinNexusto be able to integrate seamlessly with centralized applications in
addition to dApps. These applications will include exchanges, OTC platforms, lending
platforms, identity services, and others.

# Structure of FinNexus


# FinNexusApplication Scenarios

## 15

The application scenarios involved in FinNexusare essentially similar to traditional financial
application scenarios. From a demand perspective, those scenarios are derived from different
risk-return preferences over different periods of time. The usage in these scenarios are
different kinds of financial products, including asset management, financial derivatives, etc. In
order to achieve different risk-return preferences, FinNexusgenerates different business
operations based on different products for the participants.


In this scenario Bob holds BTC, is interested in participate in Wanchain'sPoSpool, and
does not want to sell his BTC for WAN. At this time, Bob's demand is to borrow WAN using
his BTC as collateral, and to allocate the borrowed WAN into the Wanchainpool node to
participate in mining. In the current situation, the entire process is very cumbersome, users
need to switch between multiple different platforms and wallets. Bob is likely to give up this
idea if his demand is not very strong.

Through FinNexus, however Bob's needs can be met much more easily. Bob must simply
initiate the transaction, and FinNexuswill handle everything behind the scenes. The
platform will find a corresponding lender for Bob to borrow WAN and will then directly
transfer the WAN to Wanchain’sPoSpool through FinNexus’spublic chain interface.

In this scenario, what was a complex multi-step process instead turns into a one click
transaction. In this way, Bob completes his entire transaction in one step, the lender earns
his corresponding interest, the mine pool node gains more users from FinNexus, and
Wanchain’stotal stake increases. In this way, FinNexuscan enrich the entire crypto
ecosystem.

# FinNexusApplication Scenarios

Some readers may wonder, aren’t there already a wide variety of different DeFi
products being offered by service providers? When basic user requirements are
examined case by case, this is in fact the case. However, the majority of DeFiuse
cases are actually composed of multiple basic user requirements, which currently can
only be met through a complex series of interactions with multiple service providers.

The goal of FinNexusis to aggregate a wide array of different services on one platform
so that user requirements can be met in a unified and streamlined way, greatly
simplifying and improving the user experience. To help readers better understand how
FinNexuswill aggregate services, several application scenarios are described below:


# FinNexusApplication Scenarios

In this application scenario, Bob wishes to purchase a high yield quantitative
cryptocurrency trading product using BTC. However, he lacks sufficient funds, so he also
requires a loan. Given the current crypto financial ecosystem, this process would require
multiple steps, and both Bob and the lender providing him with the loan will have concerns
about their financial security.

## 17


# FinNexusApplication Scenarios

This scenario becomes greatly simplified when performed via FinNexus’sinterface.
Through FinNexus, the cryptocurrency exchange’s account rights including deposit,
withdrawal, and transaction rights can all be separately controlled. Based on this fine-
grained control of rights, FinNexuswill manage the above scenario. Bob will retain the
right to withdraw his principal, the lender retains the right to withdraw the loaned funds,
and the quantitative trading team retains trading rights of both accounts. Throughout
the process, the borrower, the lender, and the asset management party are controlled
in a decentralized manner, ensuring transparency. FinNexusalso fills the role of
providing information to all parties involved.

In this scenario, for Bob, FinNexuscan complete the borrowing and investment needs
in one step, the lender is able to easily find borrowers, the quantitative trading team is
able to manage more assets, and the exchange is able to increase its trading volume,
bringing benefit to all involved.

## 18


# FinNexusApplication Scenarios

Stablecoinsare currently the primary method for mitigating the risks associated with volatile
prices within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the concept of stablecoins, especially
those backed by the US dollar, has been frequently questioned, stablecoinsare still a vital
and irreplaceable part of the crypto economy. In general, all cryptocurrency holders have a
requirement for converting their high risk / high potential reward cryptocurrencies to a lower
risk asset. Are there any other options besides stable coins? Is it possible to have a low risk
asset which also offers some level of return?

There are a number of possible assets that will be available through FinNexusthat meet this
profile. A hybrid traditional / crypto bond is just one example. A traditional bond may have
an annual return of 3%-5%. This bond can be legally tokenized through an STO, and its
tokens will be issued on a public chain via the FinNexustechnical protocol.

In this scenario, our user Bob discovers the asset through FinNexusand decided to use
some of his BTC to purchase the asset. Because it is a dollar-denominated asset, the
issuer of the token needs to receive US dollars. Through FinNexus’sOTC interface, Bob’s
BTC will be converted to USD and the bond issuer will directly receive the corresponding
USD. When the bond expires, Bob will receive his principal plus returns in the equivalent
amount of BTC which will be converted through the same FinNexusinterface. The entire
process is managed behind the scenes by the FinNexusprotocol.

In the above scenario, Bob benefits by having access to an asset with stable returns, as
well as the convenience of the simplified process. The asset issuer completes all
transactions conveniently through FinNexus, and the OTC service provider gains additional
business.


# FinNexusApplication Scenarios

In the process of converting between crypto and fiat currency, the issue of controlling
volatility often surfaces. This problem affects many cryptocurrency users. For example,
cryptocurrency miners must pay for their electricity in cash. Expat workers might wish to
send remittances back to their home countries.

In the case of individuals sending remittances back to their home country using BTC, for
example, the options for mitigating volatility are very limited. For these users, the best
option is to hedge against the price of the cryptocurrency they are using for their remittance.
This is a complex operation for users under the current state of the cryptocurrency
ecosystem which requires a sophisticated understanding of hedging strategies.

## 20


Typically, a well-paid team of finance professionals is used to devise such a strategy.
But FinNexusaims to standardize such products through technological protocols.
Users with hedging requirements only need to select the corresponding amount,
duration, and currency type on FinNexusand pay a small fee denominated in FNX
token. By this process, the user is able to convert between BTC and fiat currency in a
manner which protects them from price volatility. If the price of Bitcoin falls, the user
will get the compensation for the corresponding price difference from users of the
FinNexusplatform.

In the above scenario, the user is able to mitigate their risk, the hedging provider
obtains more business, and the off-exchange and foreign currency dealers obtain more
trading volume. That’s the type of win-win-win scenario that FNX can facilitate.

# FinNexusEconomic Model

## 22

One of the most important reasons for the success of Bitcoin (BTC) is its economic model.
In essence, Bitcoin was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto to be inflationary in the short term,
but deflationary over time. The ingenuity of this model is that short term inflation, i.e.,
mining incentives in the form of block rewards, are economic incentives for the operators
of the Bitcoin network, while the long-term deflation contributes to the strength of Bitcoin’s
value.

Bitcoin’s deflationary nature has contributed to its use as a store of value, and its
increasing acceptance as a store of value has strengthened the value of the token itself,
leading to a virtuous cycle where use drives value and value drives use.

FinNexuswill follow a similar model of short term inflation combined with long term
deflation. The actual level of inflation will depend on the level of use of the FinNexus
platform as measured by the ‘fee scale’. The ‘fee scale’ is an indicator derived from fee
data which will be used as a measure of activity on the platform. The level of inflation will
increase or decrease according to the fee scale so that inflation is on pace with the
platform usage. The difference between the FinNexusmodel and the BTC model is that
while BTC’s inflation was set in stone from the first block, FinNexus’sinflation will be
automatically adjusted according to the usage of the platform.

```
Initial Sale Te a m Operation IssuanceVariable
```
There are two stages of FNX issuance: initial issuance and future issuances through
inflation.

**Initial issuance**
The FNX total supply is 500,000,000. 30% of the total supply will be issued during the
initial sale, 25% will be reserved for the team and founding members, 30% reserved for
operations, and the remaining 15% is reserved for the inflation pool.

# FinNexusEconomic Model


**Dynamic Inflation**
According to our design, future issuance will occur during regular inflation periods. The
factors which determine the quantity of FNX issued during inflation periods include both
the ‘fee scale’ (an indicator related to the average volume of fees in the preceding period)
and the average price of FNX. New issuances will be halted if the fee scale growth stops
or decreases.

The tokens reserved for the team will be locked for one year. Over the following 30 months,
the tokens will be unlocked in stages. If the fee scale decreases in any inflation period, the
rate of tokens unlocked in that period will decrease by 50%.

The FNX dynamic inflation pool is capped at 75,000,000. If the current number of
additional issuance is less than or equal to 0 according to the following rules, the
additional issuance will be stopped in the current period. The dynamic inflation issuance
follows the following rules:

푈",$：the total volume of transactions for the ithfinancial asset class traded in FinNexus
during the t-cycle

푅",$：the transaction rate of the ithfinancial asset class traded in FinNexusduring the t-

n(t): is the total number of all financial assets in the FinNexusduring the t period

FNXPrice.：for the weighted average price of FNX in period t, from the open market price

훼 **：The transaction frequency of FNX.** In the beginning since there is no historic data for
reference, the parameter will be set to a number below 0.1. After operations have begun,
we will collect the data and determine the α in the later periods based on historical
transaction data.

# FinNexusEconomic Model

Since the transaction volume between individual adjacent periods may vary greatly,
especially in the early stages of FinNexus, and transaction volume is used in part to
determine the fee scale parameter which is used in turn to determine the dynamic inflation
rate, we will use the geometric mean volume taken over a period of multiple intervals
rather than a single interval at a time in order to smooth out the fluctuations between
periods.

Through the above-mentioned issuance and other additional parameters, the entire supply
of FNX will be thus limited by the scale of the FinNexuseconomy, in order to maximize the
value captured by each FNX in the FinNexusecosystem.

## 27

25% of FinNexusfees will be used for the buffer fund. The main role of the buffer fund is for
asset insurance. The buffer fund will be used to compensate user losses when an
uncontrollable factor causes FinNexususers to lose their assets. The buffer fund will be
managed by professionals for value preservation (for the avoidance of doubt, FNX token
holders have no rights to the assets of the buffer fund).

# FinNexusEconomic Model


**Development Plan:**
FinNexushas ambitious goals. But we have a very practical approach to reaching them
step by step. We do not intend to launch with every intended feature already
implemented, but rather we plan to gradually implement features in a series of stages.
Our initial goal is to offer a diversified set of crypto assets to users, and from that basic
functionality gradually implement the rest of our stated goals.

FinNexusis a diversified crypto asset platform suitable for different application scenarios.
The primary goal of FinNexusis to directly address user demands and provide users with
fundamental technological and business protocols.

In terms of the business logic of Phase 1, the first priority is to implement the
fundamental tools and systems to support the basic application scenarios described
above. FinNexuswill actively recruit more participants and partners to jointly implement
the tools and systems to support a variety of application scenarios. Participants will be
incentivized to join using a portion of the operations fund, and participants will be able to
continually earn profit in the form of service fees charged for the tools they implement on
FinNexus. In addition to recruiting partners who can provide assets, tools, and
applications, FinNexuswill also recruit compliance agencies and licensed financial
services agencies to join the platform so as to improve the business protocols at the
legal compliance level. Acquiring a wide range of assets and attracting and keeping
users are the key issues at this phase. We will onboard a wide range of different types of
crypto and hybrid traditional / crypto assets in order to provide crypto users with a rich
choice of products with various risk / return profiles. This diversity of digital assets will
attract users from the crypto world and the traditional world to the FinNexusecosystem.

FinNexuswill be a technological connection between mainstream public chains,
centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges and other applications. By establishing
these connections, entities with different asset demands can easily issue, operate, trade,
purchase and redeem these assets. FinNexuswill establish a system of fund settlement,
risk control, fee allocation, and other modules so as to serve the scenarios in Phase 1.

# FinNexusDevelopment Plan And

# Roadmap


FinNexuswill gradually improve its technical and business protocols. The overarching
goal is to become an open and collaborative protocol that allows for emergent use cases
and application scenarios.

In terms of business, FinNexuswill work with legitimate compliance agencies in different
regions and obtain corresponding licenses so as to clear the obstacles of compliance for
ecosystem development. By carefully adhering to the legal regulations of each relevant
business jurisdiction, FinNexuswill attract more business partners, assets, and users to
the FinNexusplatform.

FinNexuswill continually work to improve the openness of its technical protocols, the
completeness of its standards, the richness of its application scenarios, and the
decentralization of its implementation so that developers will be able to use FinNexusto
create their own powerful ecosystem applications.

# FinNexusDevelopment Plan And

# Roadmap

With the improvement of the underlying blockchain protocol and the development of
community governance, the ultimate goal of FinNexusis to become a fully decentralized
open collaborative financial protocol, and a distributed self-evolving business community
with open governance.


**According to the three phases of our development plan, the initial roadmap
of FinNexusis as follows:**

## 30

```
FinNexusofficially starts, including pre-planning, finding core
members of the FinNexusteam, negotiating with fund partners, etc.
Prepare the white paper and announcement plans.
Release the white paper. Go live with the website and officially begin
interactions with the market.
FinNexus(V 1.0) goes live. The first batch of assets go online.
FinNexus(V 2.0) goes live. The second batch of assets go online.
```
```
Deliver a functional middleware protocol layer and open parts of our
APIs to the public. The third batch of assets go online.
Complete Phase 1. The functional protocol layer will be articulated
into protocol clusters which exist both at the middleware layer and the
application layer. More APIs will be opened to the public. At this point,
we expect to have a global asset platform that can connect both
blockchain-to-blockchain (cross-chain) and blockchain-to-legacy
systems (comprehensive interoperability). At this point, we hope to
significantly expand our partnerships and integrate multiple large-
scale users using our protocol clusters in their own apps, Dapps,
platforms and products.
Standardize the middleware protocol clusters and improve
connections at each individual layer. A P2P protocol network is initially
formed. FinNexustransitions from asset platform to asset channel.
Complete Phase 2. Phase 3 begins as we attempt to fully
decentralize the P2P open sharing protocol network and develop an
effective community governance model for the entire ecosystem.
