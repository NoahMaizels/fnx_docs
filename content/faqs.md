# FAQs

### Is there any lockup for anyone?

Yes. Early participants of FinNexus have lock-up periods as follows:
The tokens reserved for the team, including the ones for the initiators as Wanchain and SuperAtom, will be locked up for one year. Over the following 30 months, the tokens will be unlocked in stages.

The tokens issued to the institutional investors will be locked up for 3 months. Over the following 12 months, the tokens will be unlocked linearly by months.
The ICTO participants will not have any lock-up periods.

### What if the price of Convertible FNX dropped below 0.1 USD, is it still convertible to UM1S?

In the conversion period, as long as the FNX tokens converted have not yet reached the upper 80% limit of the total issuance, the holders have the rights to make the conversion, no matter how the FNX price fluctuates. Due to the arbitraging activities involved in the market, the convertible FNX will be hardly dropping below 0.1 USD in the conversion period, with the conversion rights granted to the tokens.

### What are the percentages of tokens on the market in circulation after ICTO?

Due to the convertible nature of FNX in ICTO, the total issuance of FNX on the market will not be certain, until the expiration of the conversion period.

### What is the token price at different sale levels (Presale, Private & Public) if any?

In the institutional private sales stage, due to their early participation and the undertaking of higher risks in the embryonic stage of the project, discounted price was granted to the institutional investors, with the average price of 0.06 USD per FNX token.
In ICTO, which is the public sales stage, the unit price of convertible FNX is 0.1 USD.
We are discussing a presale round to the communities before ICTO within 2 months, and participants in our communities will be enjoying a discount. Further information will be disclosed later in our [official telegram group](https://t.me/FinNexusOfficial).

### What is the total supply and distribution of FNX tokens?
![](../_media/fnx-allocation.png)

As in the white paper, the potential total supply of the FNX tokens will be 500 million units, which is the upper limit of the total possible FNX tokens on the market.

1. 30% for sale

30% of the FNX tokens, which is 150 million, are for sale. There are 3 stages planned for the fundraising purpose:
(1) In the institutional private sales stage, which is almost closed now, we were invested by Genesis Capital, Consensus Capital, BKex Capital, and there are two more token funds in deep discussion at present. The total FNX tokens for sale in this stage will be no more than 8.3 million units.

(2) In the ICTO process, which is planned in Q1 2020, the total convertible FNX for sale will be no more than 60 million units. Due to the convertible essence of the tokens, the total issuance of FNX tokens is not decided until the conversion period is over, but surely will be no more than the total convertible FNX amount - 60 million units. Because the conversion of FNX to UM1S will burn the relating FNX tokens and reduce the supply.

Suppose, FinNexus successfully issues 60 million units of convertible FNX in ICTO to the upper limit, and in rare cases, no one converts in the conversion period. The largest possible amount of tokens through ICTO on the market will be 60 million, accounting for 12% of the total FNX supply.

(3) The rest of the unissued tokens will be reserved for the fundraising activities in later stages, after 2 years, for FinNexus Phase 2. Please check the roadmap in the white paper.

We can draw a line of the token issuance with the narrations above:

![](../_media/market-sales.png)

Noted that there is an upper limit of 8.3 million FNX tokens in the institutional private sales stage as shown in the chart above. The more conversion is made, the fewer FNX tokens are left on the market. The upper limited of conversion will be 48 million units of convertible FNX, which is 80% of the total amount, provided that Finnexus makes an upper limit sale in ICTO.

2. 25% for the team

The team will reserve 25% of the total tokens as future incentives, as well as the benefits for the founding investors, in which, the two initiators SuperAtom and Wanchain hold 15% in total. The other 10% will be allocated to the core team members. However, the team token allocation will have a longer lock-up period.

3. 30% for operation

30% of the tokens will be reserved for future management and operations. These tokens will be frozen for one year after ICTO, and unlocked linearly in 3 years.

4. 15% for inflation pool

15% of the tokens will be for the inflation pool.

Future inflation issuance will occur during regular inflation periods. We call the issuance as inflation, but actually it is deflation. The factors which determine the quantity of FNX issued during inflation periods include both the 'fee scale' (an indicator related to the average volume of fees in the preceding period) and the average price of FNX. New issuances will be halted if the fee scale growth stops or decreases. Moreover, there is a parameter α determining the issuance, which will always be much smaller than 1. It means that the new issuance will be smaller than the actual demand in the operations, causing the long-term deflation of FNX.

Please refer to the [white paper](https://www.finnexus.io/FinNexus_Whitepaper_en.pdf) for a more detailed inflation pool model.

### Why is Finnexus special?  
Our closest competitors are traditional financial institutions which offer low risk, non blockchain based stable return and fixed return products. Our other competitors would be platforms such as Binance and Compound which offer centralized or decentralized stable return products based on crypto lending businesses.

FinNexus has a unique focus on assets with real value built on blockchain infrastructure, which is rare in our other DeFi projects. Unlike Binance and Compound whose stable return products are based on crypto lending businesses, the assets we issue include those based on both real world and crypto businesses, which gives users access to reliable assets which are not correlated with the performance of crypto markets. And unlike traditional institutions, all our products are built on blockchain, which enables them to make use of all the blockchain’s advantages.

### What's the future of DeFi?  
Our expectation of the future DeFi is mainly on the application level rather than a technical one.

Borrowing and Lending cannot be everything about DeFi. The growth of the DeFi should be largely diversified to other assets and business models.
The risks in the DeFi world is similar, in other words, most of the DeFi models are facing the same systematic risks, which are with high risk and high expected return characteristics. In cases when the bitcoin collapses, every businesses and scenarios will be affected. This is not healthy.
The DeFi applications are not so user-friendly. One has to take some time to learn how to deal with one decentralized product.

A leading project in the future should have the ability to solve the problems above. Blockchain is a great technology, while the combination with finance cannot avoid the basic logic and be isolated from the successful scenarios and models we built. Different models here mean different application scenarios in the financial world, like the equity rights, debenture rights, derivatives or other beneficiary rights.

The centralized or decentralized cannot be questions like yes or no. During the process of development, there may be something in between. On one hand it is built in a decentralized way and smart contracts are triggered automatically; while on the other hand, it is adapting the realistic that some parts of transactions or measurements must be under centralized regulations. We would like to call it Open Finance, as it is open to both the crypto assets on the blockchain, and the assets off the chain while restructuring their parts in a decentralized way.

In the future, we believe that there will be leading projects, that can bridge the blockchain technology and real world assets, diversify the systematic risks while attracting more users, and be user friendly that the nonprofessional may easily operate.

### Why should I invest?  
I hope you read the write paper of FinNexus and got understandings on what FinNexus is about to do. FNC will be the sole token in the FinNexus ecosystem. It is a kind of hybrid token, like a utility token but also benefiting from FinNexus development.

FinNexus will work as the financial product supermarket, Broker, Investment Banker or something alike. It will gain revenue directly from its operations.
Holders of FNC is eligible to the following rights or benefits (will be explained in details on the FinNexus official websites):

1. Rights of higher rate of returns on tokenized products;
2. Rights to invest in tokenized products with lower cost;
3. Benefits on the discount on the transaction commissions;
4. Derivative rights, like early settlement, resale or interest swaps;
5. Rights to interact with WAN;
6. Benefits on the FinNexus’ development; the revenue of FinNexus is from: Underwriting; Investment banking; Market making; Transaction commissions; Investment in tokenized products.

### Can you explain FinNexus simply?
You can actually get a clue from the project’s name ‘FinNexus’. The name is quite straightforward. FinNexus is the combination of the words ‘Finance’ and ‘Nexus’. It means financial connections. I will explain that in 3 aspects:

1. To asset owners
Finance here includes the ‘traditional’ and the ‘decentralized’ and traditional finance is only traditional compared to DeFi. Here FinNexus is aiming at providing a solution, which we call it a protocol, where one can link the traditional financial world with the blockchain technology in an efficient, transparent and feasible way. For example, one with assets that have good expected cash flows will find a way to easily tokenize the assets on FinNexus.
2. To users
FinNexus will act as a financial product supermarket. Right now, the DeFi world has a problem that almost all of the crypto assets or financial products bear the same systematic risks, which means when the Bitcoin price collapses, every kind will join the plummet and even the financial models will cease to be valid. One of the reasons is that all assets are purely crypto-born. Moreover, the crypto interface is not so easy for a nonprofessional to operate. FinNexus’ goal is to provide diversification and convenience with assets of real value. Users will be able to invest in assets with various risks and returns here, and can easily choose to their preferences like in a supermarket.
3. FinNexus Itself
FinNexus is concentrating in the application level, with the help of the two initiators. It will not operate or manage assets directly and will act as a channel or a hub, where supplies and needs are paired, while in later stages, it will strive to build the protocols or standards for all of these tokenizations and transactions.

### How are FinNexus assets different?
The FinNexus team have done researches on the tokenization of real world assets. Right now, only a few groups like the credit assets, supply chain finance or other sub-dividable beneficial rights seem most feasible. These tokenized products may bear characteristics like equities, debentures, derivatives or other beneficiary rights.

The noticeable differences lie in the nature of the products. The returns are from the cashflow of the real world assets, rather than mining, staking, speculating, etc. FinNexus combines the decentralized and centralized means. The tokens have advantages on chain, while the product design and disclosure draw lessons from traditional finance.

Apart from that, there will also be products totally on chain, triggered by smart contracts, like crypto futures, options, and ETFs, with user-friendly interfaces.

### How does FinNexus plan to develop in and outside China?
Advantages:
1. The blockchain industrial environment and public opinion guidance has changed since China’s President Xi Jinping recent announcement. The word blockchain has been mentioned in social media time and time again, and almost everyone is trying to find out what it is. President made it clear that the country would encourage enterprises applying the technology into real world scenarios.
2. China has the largest population and made great technological progress over the last decade. Blockchain projects, communities, exchanges, token funds, medias, and other participants have established a complete and dynamic ecosystem. FinNexus is easy to access to these resources.
3. Financial market in China has been making great progress, which provides FinNexus with adequate talents, financial products and potential users.
4. The two initiators Wanchain and SuperAtom (incubated by Cheetah Mobile) are all based in China. They both give FinNexus big financial, human-power and community support, with minimum communication cost in the same city.

Disadvantages:
1. Activities like ICOs or other forms of public fund-raising are still restricted;
2. The government’s attitude towards the security-like tokens and tokenization is still not clear;
3. Language and time zone discrepancy may cause difficulties.
FinNexus is aiming to build a global open finance protocol. Blockchain should be boundless, and so will be our users and assets. Our first product’s basic asset is in SE Asia. We are now building teams, grouping communities, and recruiting regional ambassadors. Also, we are making continuous and effective interactions with the global communities of Wanchain and Bitrue.

### Who is the FinNexus team?
Though key members of FinNexus team seem to have different educational backgrounds or working experiences, we come together with the same beliefs and goals. The same purpose has united us together and after grinding-in over one and a half years, we are working together energetically and harmoniously, which provides a foundation for the success of FinNexus. It is not the first time we work together and we knew each other with for long time. The details of resumes are on the website.

### Will FinNexus help the unbanked?
The team has been working together for more than a year already. FinNexus is a project at the layer 3 level in the blockchain system, targeting at the application usage. The team believes that no matter how innovative or revolutionary a new technology is, if it fails to be conveniently applied in everyday use or have efficient or cost-saving solutions to users, we cannot call it a successful technology.

Therefore, we will build our application on top of the successful public chains and concentrate in providing financially practical and risk diversified products and user friendly applications. We doubt that the unbanked can be helped by a complex system. Unbanked group of people usually exist in the less developed regions that lack basic infrastructure. They may not well educated or lack the basic understanding of the technology or even ideas of modern financial or banking system.

Therefore, the application is most important. A successful project should provide them with friendly interfaces and convenient accesses, aiming directly to their basic needs, no matter how complex or innovative the technology is. That’s what FinNexus is trying to do, to provide what is needed the most in a simple and understandable way.

### What is the token sale format?
We create a new way of the token sales together with launching our products. FinNexus’ will issue its CFNC (convertible FNC), which gives holders the right to convert into ABT in the conversion period. The holders of ABT are eligible to the benefit with an annualized rate of return at over 10%. ABT is called the Asset Backed Token in general, in specific, the return of the token is backed by the consumer loan assets in Indonesia, with the originator SuperAtom, which is initiated by the NYSE listed company Cheetah Mobile, as the basic asset. It has a traditional hierarchical design and the ABT is the token in the senior tranche. The details will be disclosed in the Offering Circular on the FinNexus website later.
We strongly recommend the interested blockchainers to check the details on www.finnexus.io

### What is the future roadmap?
In phase one, before the end of 2019 or early in 2020, FinNexus is introducing ICTO, combining the fund raising process with its products. Instruments with the essentials of ABT are likely to be one of the major products offered to users, with different systematic risks from the crypto assets. Before the first quarter of 2020, other products like the borrowing and lending, hedging, ETF and staking are likely to be issued, as well as the other schemes of the ABT products. FinNexus will also cooperate with at least three of the token exchanges, crypto wallets or other channels as the sale portals.

In phase two, before the end of 2020, FinNexus will search for the qualified assets globally and combine the blockchain technology with the real world application scenarios in vaster occasions. And FinNexus work with other mainnet projects to launch its new products and interactions with the chain tokens. Moreover, FinNexus will facilitate the trade of the ABT and other similar products on the OTC market. The experience of the traditional financial market shows that the OTC transactions of these products have even higher volume than the bidding mode in the exchanges.

In the third phase, in three years, FinNexus’ goal is to build an open finance protocol. This protocol is established on Layer 3, targeted on the application level. It will provide the basic standard for the tokenization and transaction for all types of assets, both in traditional finance and in the crypto world. All assets that provide future returns will be programmable with blockchain in the future and FinNexus is defining a protocol that provides the standards and convenience in realization. Different assets may apply to various requirements in details, but the common language lying in is what FinNexus is chasing for.
While in the coming days, we would expect 1) the release of the detailed conversion and subscription rules on the website; 2) the release of the ABT offering circular to give a detailed explanation on the risks and returns; 3) setting the timetable for offering and listing of FNC.

### What is the current progress of the project?
The first product will be released together with ICTO process, details of which you may check on the FinNexus website. Right now, the product is under the final stage of development and the team are working on the necessary information disclosure materials and the design of tokens on Wanchain. The planned release time will be before the end of this year or early next year.
What are FinNexus's technical plans?

FinNexus is a project built on layer 3 and concentrates on technological application. ‘We are the portal to the users and we need to make it simple, convenient, understandable and transparent’.

The advantage does not lie in the sophistication of the underlying technology, but in the application level. To establish an Open Finance Protocol, FinNexus has to move earlier and faster than the others, and at present, it is the first in the industry to put forward this concept.

In product development, we will make each code be used in real use case and keep improving in practice. In the beginning, we will built a layer 3 for assets tokenization and distribution, fee and interests distribution, buying and withdrawing. Users (business users) do not need to connect public chains, but use our SDK or API to interact with different chains. Recently we are focusing on protocols with smart contracts that asset tokenization could be easily deployed by FNX layer 3. And then we will focus on the protocol of decentralized token distribution. That means anyone who wants to sell assets tokens in FinNexus only need to download our SDK or connect our API.
What assets will be offered in which countries?

As a project incubated by SuperAtom, the UangMe assets will work as an initiator, and it has the potential of the amount of 100M USD. In the meantime, similar assets in Malaysia are under discussion. In addition, there will be other types of products the users may expect in the first quarter of 2020, like crypto borrowing and lending products, easy-operating crypto-currency derivatives, ETF products, staking related products, etc., and they are all under development right now.

We have a legal team that help us deal with the jurisdiction issues. We will monitor the changing legal environment around the main countries and regions. KYC procedures are necessary for avoiding investors from holding assets from restricted jurisdictions.

### How do FinNexus and Wanchain work together?
FinNexus is the layer 3 which can make users, especially business users, to use Wanchain easily in financial aspects. And FinNexus focuses on different assets, that could grant Wanchain with more applications to run. In most of financial scenarios, multi-coin will be used, so we can use the cross-chain protocol of Wanchain. If Wanchain protocol is like a highway road, FinNexus protocol is working as an assembly line.

### What is the current DeFi landscape?
Now, many DeFi projects are limited to the products and applications with the pure crypto assets. They can be highly decentralized and automated, but is it enough?

1. Borrowing and Lending is the first natural DeFi application scenario and contributes to over 90% of the application scenarios. It cannot be everything about DeFi. The growth of the DeFi should be largely diversified to other assets and business models.
2. The risks in the DeFi world is similar, in other words, most of the DeFi models are facing the same systematic risks, which are with high risk and high expected return characteristics. In cases when the bitcoin collapses, every businesses and scenarios will be affected. This is not healthy. Tokens transactions with high risks and the relating credit activities cannot be the whole world of DeFi. FinNexus is trying to introduce financial products with different types and levels of risks and expected returns, to enrich the products desperately needed in the industry.
3. The DeFi applications are not so user-friendly. One has to take some time to learn how to deal with one decentralized product. FinNexus aims at providing something that is transparent with the information needed for the investors to make judgment while easy to handle.

Right now, Maker is trying to move to Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD), a big step to make the DeFi model richer and healthier. Also they introduce Dai Savings Rate (DSR), which may have the potential to be regarded as one of the standard rates. In the future, we may witness wider real world assets and application scenarios in DeFi and that is the path that DeFi is bound to follow.
Can FinNexus support smart contracts?

The answer is yes, smart contracts will play important roles in the FinNexus products. The first phase of products will be built on Wanchain and according to the ICTO rules, the ABT conversion and the future payment of principal and interest of ABT will all be supported by smart contracts. Again, for details of ICTO please check our website. In later phases ,we will develop other products based on ETH or other chains according to the users’ requirements and asset characteristics; and smart contracts will be richer and more diversified.

### Why do we need DeFi?

Decentralized blockchain technology needs application scenarios, and the finance needs the innovative technology to solve its own problems, thus here comes the merge of the two.

Bitcoin brings the blockchain technology into our sight and until now, it has 70% of the total value of crypto assets. Bitcoin is born to facilitate the financial transactions and most of the project henceforth cannot be isolated from the financial fields. There is an inevitable bond since the birth of the technology, and finance is always the natural experimental field of blockchain.
The problem of information asymmetry is always puzzling investors and regulators. Most of the solution came from a centralized way from the authorities before, while the result was much diversified among regions. With the emergence of blockchain, it provides an alternative solution to this long-lasting issue. It is trustworthy, non-modifiable and self-proved. Moreover, it is bondless and anti-authorized, which can largely reduce the cost of international transactions while enhancing the efficiency. The technology is self-organized, decentralized and automated. DeFi has the potential to change the governance structure and investment behavior in the financial world.
Tens of years ago, the internet has brought finance efficiency and popularization. Today blockchain is about to change the financial system again. It introduces the participants into a new territory that is bondless, decentralized, trustworthy, and equal. It will largely decrease the cost of centralized supervision, the risk of information asymmetry and the barrier among economic entities. Many business formats will change concerning the technology, including the economic entities, governance authorities, market intermediaries, exchanges and the transaction behavior of investors. For example, in the future, it is expected that the basic bookkeeping of a business entity will be on blockchain, and all of the operational activities like procurement, production, sales, inventories, invoices, taxations, employments, etc., will be dealt with and recorded in a decentralized way. Therefore, the auditors’ jobs are shifting from the bookkeeping test of accuracy to the verification of the validity of the chain.

Of course, FinNexus is born to be part of the big change, and we strive to be one of the driving forces of the financial decentralization progress. The goal of FinNexus is to build an Open Finance Protocol. The protocol is like a channel or a standard, to allow all kinds of assets, whether decentralized or centralized, whether with characteristics of equity, debenture, derivative or other hybrid, to find its path towards tokenization with the blockchain technology. By maintaining the basic business logic and learning from the traditional financial model, FinNexus will combine with the advantages of the blockchain technology, to make investors truly benefit from decentralization.

### Who is the target user?
FinNexus aims to serve those who know blockchain and have invested in crypto assets or DeFi products, those who know real world investment but little about blockchain, and those who know little about crypto assets or financial investment but interested in the blockchain technology and curious on the virtual assets.

The meaning of ‘Nexus’ has many parts, and one is to make connections with different market participants. FinNexus will work through protocols and try to act as a channel. In future stages, it will make connections with the OTC markets providing fiat and crypto currency exchanges. Through these protocols, non-crypto users will be able to invest in the FinNexus products.
As FinNexus is built on Layer 3, the protocol will be built combining the decentralized and centralized solution. User-friendliness is a must. By means of easy interfaces, full information disclosure and integrated protocols, users with various degree of knowledge and different risk tolerance are able to get their suitable investment, easily and transparently.
